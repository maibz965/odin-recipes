    <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
    <li>1 white onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 Fresno chili pepper, seeded and halved, or more to tasted</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, skin on</li>
 </ul>

    <li>Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.</li>

Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.</li>
    <li>Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the ambient temperature next to the pan. Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. If cooking next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.</li>
